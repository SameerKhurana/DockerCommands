Docker Storage

storage drivers and file system

How docker stores data and manage file systems?

File System

/var/lib/docker
	aufs
	containers
	image
	volumes

This is where docker stores all its data by default.
//data: files related to images and contianers running on the docker host. 

// Images are readonly and can be edited only by new build.

Docker creates a container based of these layers and creates a new writable layer  on top of image layer.

The writable layer is used to create data on the conatiner such as logs files, any temp files or file modified by user.


Life of writeable layer same as life of contaianer.

Same image layer is shared by multiple containers. 


We can still modify the file (code) in image layer (read only)
but before the saving the modified file , docker creates a copy in read write layer then we would be modifying a different version of file in read write layer.

All the future modifications will be done on this copy of file in read write layer.

this is called COPY ON WRITE meachanism.

This modified data will be lost when we build the image again.

How to persist this data?

Add persistent volumes to the container.
